# Arduino DHT22 (#2)

This is a simple Arduino application that reads temperature and humidity data from a [DHT22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385) device. This version of the application uses data received by the sensor to turn on one or more (I've not decided yet) LEDs based on temperature threshold.
